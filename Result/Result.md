Summary of Trends from the Results

1. OFI Trends (Plot 1 - “OFI Trends for AAPL”)
   
	•	The Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) for AAPL exhibits noticeable spikes and oscillations, particularly for Bid Level 1 and Ask Level 1.
	•	Higher Levels of the Limit Order Book (LOB) (e.g., Bid Level 4, Ask Level 4) show relatively muted or stable trends compared to the lower levels.
	•	These sharp fluctuations at lower levels of the LOB (Bid/Ask Levels 1) likely indicate significant trading activity or aggressive order placement, which dominates price movements.

3. Cross-Impact Coefficients (Plot 2 - “Cross-Impact Coefficients”)

	•	Key Observations:
	•	AAPL exhibits positive cross-impact on other stocks, especially AMGN and XOM, with coefficients in the range of 5.2 * 10^{-5} to 7.1 * 10^{-5}.
	•	JPM shows negative self-impact (-6.8 * 10^{-4}) and cross-impact on XOM (-2.1 * 10^{-4}).
	•	AMGN has negligible influence on itself and other stocks, with all coefficients close to zero. This suggests AMGN’s activity is less interconnected with the broader market.
	•	XOM displays significant negative self-impact (-5.5 * 10^{-4}), indicating internal OFI imbalances might suppress its price movements.

Sector Relationships:

	•	Energy (XOM):
	•	XOM has negative self-impact, showing that its internal OFI dynamics likely contribute to its price suppression. However, XOM is mildly affected by AAPL, indicating cross-sector influence.
	•	Technology (AAPL):
	•	AAPL demonstrates notable positive cross-impact on other stocks, including AMGN and XOM. This reflects how the technology sector can drive broader market trends due to its high liquidity and trading volumes.
	•	Healthcare (AMGN):
	•	AMGN shows minimal cross-impact on or from other stocks, indicating its order flow imbalance and price changes are relatively independent of broader market activity.
	•	Financials (JPM):
	•	JPM shows negative self-impact and negative cross-impact on XOM, which might indicate sector-level competition or counter-balancing dynamics between financials and energy.
	•	Consumer Discretionary (TSLA):
	•	TSLA’s coefficients are generally small, suggesting weaker relationships with other stocks in this dataset.

3. General Observations:
	•	Positive Cross-Impact:
	•	Positive cross-impact coefficients (e.g., AAPL → AMGN, AAPL → XOM) suggest that order flow imbalances in highly liquid stocks like AAPL can influence price movements in other sectors.
	•	Negative Self-Impact:
	•	Significant negative self-impact (e.g., JPM and XOM) indicates that these stocks are more reactive to internal imbalances rather than external market-wide influences.
