Summary of Observed Trends
1. Cross-Impact Relationships (Heatmap)
	•	AAPL (Technology):
	•	Strong positive cross-impact on AMGN and XOM, with coefficients of 5.2 * 10^-5 and 7.1 * 10^-5, respectively.
	•	This indicates AAPL is a dominant market driver, influencing the price movements of other stocks significantly.
	•	AMGN (Healthcare):
	•	Negligible cross-impact coefficients across all stocks (close to zero), showing sector independence and limited influence on or from other equities.
	•	JPM (Financials):
	•	Notable negative self-impact (-6.8 * 10^-4), reflecting sensitivity to its internal order flow imbalances.
	•	Negative cross-impact with XOM (-2.1 * 10^-4) aligns with macroeconomic dependencies, where financials and energy often exhibit inverse relationships.
	•	TSLA (Consumer Discretionary):
	•	Moderate positive cross-impact on XOM (1.7 * 10^-5), possibly driven by broader market trends but less significant compared to AAPL.
	•	XOM (Energy):
	•	Strong negative self-impact (-5.5 * 10^-4) suggests internal trading dynamics dominate its price movements, with limited cross-sector dependencies except AAPL.

2. OFI Trends by Stock

AAPL (Technology)
	•	The Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) for AAPL shows significant fluctuations, particularly at Bid Level 1 and Ask Level 1, indicating high trading activity at the top of the order book.
	•	The higher levels of the order book (e.g., Bid Level 4, Ask Level 4) exhibit more stability, with less drastic movements.
	•	AAPL appears to be a highly influential stock, likely due to its high trading volume and liquidity in the technology sector.

AMGN (Healthcare)
	•	AMGN exhibits a highly symmetric and repetitive pattern in its OFI trends, with bid and ask levels alternating frequently.
	•	These patterns suggest low market dominance and independent price dynamics with minimal external influence from other stocks.
	•	OFI levels for AMGN are relatively small compared to other stocks, indicating lower trading volumes or limited high-frequency activity.

JPM (Financials)
	•	OFI for JPM demonstrates sharp spikes, particularly at Bid Level 3 and Ask Level 2, showing episodic bursts of activity.
	•	Such bursts might be related to macroeconomic news or sector-specific announcements influencing financial stocks.
	•	JPM’s self-impact and negative cross-impact coefficients in the broader analysis highlight its susceptibility to internal imbalances rather than external influences.

TSLA (Consumer Discretionary)
	•	TSLA shows extreme OFI values, especially at Ask Levels 1 and 2, where spikes exceed thousands.
	•	These outliers might indicate periods of highly aggressive market orders or imbalance driven by market makers during intense trading windows.
	•	The magnitude of TSLA’s OFI imbalances suggests it plays a pivotal role in driving sector-wide market dynamics.

XOM (Energy)
	•	OFI for XOM exhibits moderate oscillations across all bid and ask levels, showing relatively balanced trading activity.
	•	The negative self-impact coefficient observed in the cross-impact heatmap aligns with its internal dynamics driving price stability rather than external cross-sector influence.
	•	Sectoral influence from financial stocks (e.g., JPM) appears to be weakly negative, possibly due to the inverse correlation between energy and financials under specific market conditions.

Sector Relationships and Cross-Impact Insights
	•	Technology (AAPL):
	•	Strong positive cross-impact on other sectors, notably energy (XOM) and healthcare (AMGN), indicating AAPL’s broader influence in driving overall market trends.
	•	Healthcare (AMGN):
	•	Minimal cross-impact with other sectors, suggesting that AMGN’s order flow imbalances are largely independent.
	•	Financials (JPM):
	•	Negative cross-impact with XOM reflects inverse relationships often observed between financial and energy stocks due to macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, oil prices).
	•	Consumer Discretionary (TSLA):
	•	High OFI values indicate sector dominance and potential as a market driver, although its cross-impact relationships remain weaker than AAPL’s.
	•	Energy (XOM):
	•	Negative self-impact reflects internal imbalances, with relatively weaker cross-sector dependencies except for minor influence from AAPL.

General Observations
	1.	Dominance of AAPL and TSLA:
	•	AAPL and TSLA exhibit the largest OFI spikes, indicating their high liquidity and potential as drivers of broader market movements.
	2.	Sector Independence:
	•	AMGN shows strong independence in its OFI dynamics, highlighting the isolated nature of healthcare stocks in high-frequency trading.
	3.	Inverse Relationships:
	•	Negative cross-impact between JPM (Financials) and XOM (Energy) aligns with known sectoral dependencies, driven by macroeconomic conditions.
